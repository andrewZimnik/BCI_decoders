# BCI examples

This repo is a testbed for different BCI algorithms. It includes `code` for training various decoders as well as `notebooks` for implementing the code. 
The `data` was collected from the motor cortex of a rhesus macaque performing a center-out reaching task. For full details on the task, see [Churchland et al., 2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11129).
